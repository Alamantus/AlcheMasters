# AlcheMasters

An attempt to make a fantasy potion-themed AR game using geolocation and compass heading in Phaser and ES6/ES2015.

## This Branch

This branch is where the testing happens. My local directory structure is set up like this:

```
--Alchemasters
|
|----master
|    |
|    |----src
|
|----gh-pages
```

where the master directory is the master branch and the gh-pages directory is just this gh-pages branch.
My webpack configuration is set up to compile the contents of master/src/ directly into gh-pages/, which I then
push commits up to GitHub so I can use the GitHub Pages' https, which is now necessary for using geolocaiton on
mobile browsers.

Because of this, this branch will contain TONS of tiny commits just for me to test with.
